# Scouting
ðŸ¤– FRC scouting app that allows you to create templates, do pit scouting and use scouting schedules while being highly flexible and adaptable.

## How does it work?
This app isn't game or year specific. Instead of creating a new app every year which requires extra, unneccessary work, this app works for any game, any year. Simply create a template using the built-in editor to create a personalized pit and/or match scouting template that works for your team, and select it in the settings menu. That's it. If you choose to change what data your team is collecting when scouting at different events, simply create another template and use it. It's fast, easy and requires no coding knowledge.
